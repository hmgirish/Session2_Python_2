1. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
generate a list.

Solution:

p = 3.1415926535897931
r = 6.0  # The diameter of the sphere is 12cm and the radius is half of the diameter, so the radius would be 6cm.
v = 4.0/3.0*p*r**3  # The formula for the volume of a sphere is V=4/3*Ï€*r^3
print ('The volume of the sphere is: ', v)
